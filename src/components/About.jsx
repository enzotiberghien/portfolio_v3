      <p className='md-6/6 md:w-4/6 font-sans'>Hello! I'm Enzo Tiberghien, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer. I have recently graduated and am eager to embark on my professional journey in the tech industry. My strongest skills lie in JavaScript, but I am also proficient in other languages such as Java and C#.
        Before pursuing a career in coding, I worked in restaurants, where I honed my skills in teamwork, communication, and time management. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual ready to tackle challenges in the tech world. I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and grow as a developer.
